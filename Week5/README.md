# Week 5 Exercises and Programming Challenges

### Problem 1: Adding, Dividing, Subtracting, and Multiplying
- **Problem Description**: In this program, you will create a C++ program that performs a series of mathematical operations on a user-inputted number.
- **Instructions**:
  - Ask the user to input a number.
  - Add 40 to the number.
  - Divide the result by 5.
  - Subtract 6 from the new result.
  - Multiply the resultant value by 10.
  - Display the final result.

### Problem 2: Meter to Inches Conversion
- **Problem Description**: In this program, you will create a C++ program that converts length from meters to inches.
- **Instructions**:
  - Ask the user to input a length in meters.
  - Convert the length to inches using the conversion factor: 1 meter = 39.37 inches.
  - Display the converted length in inches.

### Problem 3: GPA Calculator
- **Problem Description**: In this program, you will create a C++ program to calculate the GPA based on user-provided marks and credit hours.
- **Instructions**:
  - Prompt the user to enter the number of courses they want to calculate GPA for.
  - For each course, ask for the marks and credit hours.
  - Calculate the GPA using the formula: GPA = (Σ(Grade Points)) / (Σ(Credit Hours)), where Grade Points are calculated based on the marks obtained.
  - Display the calculated GPA.

### Problem 4: Circle Area Calculator
- **Problem Description**: In this program, you will create a C++ program to calculate the area of a circle based on the user-provided radius.
- **Instructions**:
  - Ask the user to input the radius of the circle.
  - Calculate the area of the circle using the formula: Area = π * r * r, where π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.
  - Display the calculated area.

### Problem 5: Days to Years, Months, and Days Conversion
- **Problem Description**: In this program, you will create a C++ program that converts a given number of days into years, months, and days.
- **Instructions**:
  - Ask the user to input the number of days.
  - Calculate the equivalent number of years, months, and days.
  - Display the result in the format "X years Y months Z days."
